<h1>Alert message</h1>
this exercise will work like a pop up notification with a message and when you close the message,it will fade away and the other message will replace it.(mix of opacity and display)
<h2>Strategy</h2>
at first I wrote the function with only display but I couldn't add any effect to it so I added opacity but without display It wont go away entirely so by putting the change into a setTimeOut,I added the effect
<h3>Note</h3>
if you go to the code and just add another message in the html,it will work just fine
